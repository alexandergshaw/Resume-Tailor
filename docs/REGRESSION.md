# Regression Suite

The living record of behavior that must keep working. Stage 10 of the development
loop runs this whole document once per group, before that group is pushed.

Rules:

- Acceptance criteria are appended here when a feature clears stage 9. A feature
  is not done until its AC lives in this file.
- Nothing is ever deleted because it became inconvenient. A case is removed only
  when the behavior it describes is deliberately retired, and the removal is
  stated in the commit that removes it.
- A case that cannot be automated still belongs here, marked `automatable: no`,
  with the manual steps written out. Blocked is not the same as passing.

## Case format

Each case is one `###` heading followed by the three labelled blocks. The stage 10
workflow parses this shape, so keep it exact.

`parallel-safe: no` means the case cannot run beside another case: it builds, starts
or restarts a server, writes to a shared output directory such as `.next`, depends on
a specific working-tree state, or mutates files. Read-only inspection and scoped test
runs are `parallel-safe: yes`.

### R-000 | area: example | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** Template case. Copy this shape; do not run it.

**Steps:**
1. Describe the exact command or interaction, not a paraphrase.
2. One numbered step per action.

**Expected:** The observable result, specific enough that a reader can tell a pass
from a fail without judgement calls.

## Cases

### R-001 | area: cover-letter-grounding | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** With a tailored resume supplied, the cover letter prompt grounds on it and drops the instruction that steered the model away from the resume's language.

**Steps:**
1. From `hello-world`, run `npx vitest run lib/llm/buildCoverLetterPrompt.test.js`.

**Expected:** All tests pass. The prompt built with a usable `tailoredResume` contains the tailored-resume header and the tailored text, also contains the original resume as background grounding, and does NOT contain the phrase "do not copy phrasing wholesale".

### R-002 | area: cover-letter-grounding | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** Without a usable tailored resume, the prompt falls back to the original pre-feature behavior.

**Steps:**
1. From `hello-world`, run `npx vitest run lib/llm/buildCoverLetterPrompt.test.js`.

**Expected:** When `tailoredResume` is undefined, null, or carries only whitespace, the prompt contains the "Source resume (for factual grounding only" header including "do not copy phrasing wholesale", and does not contain the tailored-resume header.

### R-003 | area: cover-letter-structure | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** Sourcing content from the resume must never loosen the letter's structural constraints. This is the guard against the feature silently degrading formatting.

**Steps:**
1. From `hello-world`, run `npx vitest run lib/llm/buildCoverLetterPrompt.test.js`.

**Expected:** In BOTH the tailored and fallback branches the prompt still contains: the exact output-line-count constraint derived from `templateLines.length`, the per-line budget wording "within +/-10%" and "Never exceed +15%.", the blank-template-lines rule, and the JSON-only output shape. The total-character constraint reflects the sum of the template line lengths.

### R-004 | area: cover-letter-grounding | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** Client-supplied tailored resume lines take precedence over the resume tailored in the same request. This is what makes cover-only regeneration use the resume you are actually keeping.

**Steps:**
1. From `hello-world`, run `npx vitest run app/api/tailor/pickTailoredResume.test.js`.

**Expected:** All tests pass. Non-empty client lines win over a populated resume result; an empty, missing, or non-array client value falls through to the resume result; a null or undefined resume result yields an empty shape rather than throwing.

### R-005 | area: cover-letter-grounding | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** The tailored resume text resolver treats unusable input as absent so the caller can fall back.

**Steps:**
1. From `hello-world`, run `npx vitest run lib/llm/resolveTailoredResumeText.test.js`.

**Expected:** All tests pass, including that a whitespace-only `result` falls through to `resultLines` rather than winning, and that `result` takes precedence over `resultLines` when both carry content.

### R-006 | area: cover-letter-grounding | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** The tailoring route wires the tailored resume through to the engine, and the client sends its stored lines only on a cover-only revise. Not covered by unit tests: the client-side form append lives inside a React hook and is verified by inspection here.

**Steps:**
1. Read `hello-world/app/api/tailor/route.js` and locate the `tailorCoverLetter` call.
2. Read `hello-world/app/hooks/useDocumentPreview.js` and locate the `tailoredResumeLines` form append and the `applyCover` definition.

**Expected:** The route passes a `tailoredResume` option built by `pickTailoredResume`. The client appends `tailoredResumeLines` guarded by `applyCover`, and `applyCover` is defined as the cover scope AND not a focus change, so a focus change or a resume-scope revise falls through to the freshly tailored resume instead of stale stored lines.

### R-007 | area: engine-parity | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** The embedded and external engines tolerate the new option without behavior change, and embedded output stays deterministic.

**Steps:**
1. From `hello-world`, run `npx vitest run`.

**Expected:** The full suite passes with no tailor-lite determinism failures. The embedded engine accepts `tailoredResume` via its options object without destructuring it; the external engine's outbound HTTP body is unchanged.

### R-008 | area: headless-tailoring | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** Automated queue tailoring grounds the letter in the resume it just tailored, not a re-extraction of the original upload.

**Steps:**
1. Read `hello-world/lib/feed/tailorAndQueue.js` around the `tailorCoverLetterHeadless` call.
2. Read `hello-world/lib/llm/tailorForUserHeadless.js` for the `tailoredResume` parameter.

**Expected:** `tailorAndQueue.js` passes `tailoredResume` built from the resume draft it generated moments earlier, and `tailorCoverLetterHeadless` accepts and forwards it to the engine.

### R-009 | area: gates | parallel-safe: no | automatable: yes

**Summary:** Project gates are green. Exclusive because the build writes to shared output.

**Steps:**
1. From `hello-world`, run `npx eslint .`
2. From `hello-world`, run `npx vitest run`
3. From `hello-world`, run `npm run build`

**Expected:** eslint reports zero errors and zero warnings. vitest reports at least 816 passing tests with zero failures. The build compiles successfully. Note `tsc --noEmit` is not applicable: this project has `jsconfig.json` and no `tsconfig.json`.

### R-011 | area: preview-concurrency | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** Working on one document must not disable the other. This is the core of per-document concurrency.

**Steps:**
1. From `hello-world`, run `npx vitest run lib/tailor/previewScopes.lockScopesFor.test.js lib/tailor/previewScopes.applyScopeFlags.test.js`.
2. Read `app/components/DocumentPreviewDialog.js` and locate every `disabled=` guard.

**Expected:** Tests pass. The per-scope download and revise controls are gated on `busyActive` (the active tab's own flag), NOT on `anyBusy`. Only the combined download and the both-document operations (focus picker, framing, scan posting) use `anyBusy`.

### R-012 | area: preview-concurrency | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** A finishing operation on one document must not discard uncommitted edits on the other. This was a silent data-loss path.

**Steps:**
1. From `hello-world`, run `npx vitest run lib/tailor/previewScopes.changedScopes.test.js`.
2. Read the `reloadKey` handling block in `app/components/DocumentPreviewDialog.js`.

**Expected:** Tests pass, including that a scope missing from the previous signatures counts as changed. The reload handler clears cached renders and `draftHtmlRef` only for scopes whose content signature actually changed, and only drops out of edit mode when the ACTIVE scope changed.

### R-013 | area: preview-concurrency | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** busy, notice and error are per-scope objects, and no surviving code treats them as scalars. An object is always truthy, so a missed truthiness check would pin a banner open permanently.

**Steps:**
1. From `hello-world`, search `app/hooks/useDocumentPreview.js`, `app/page.js` and `app/components/DocumentPreviewDialog.js` for reads of `busy`, `notice` and `error`.

**Expected:** Every consumer indexes by scope (for example `busy?.[tab]`, `notice?.[tab] || ""`). No bare truthiness test on the whole object exists anywhere.

### R-014 | area: preview-concurrency | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** Re-entrancy guards are ref-based, not render-closure based, so a fast double-click cannot slip through.

**Steps:**
1. Read `resubmitDocumentPreview` and `downloadDocumentPreview` in `app/hooks/useDocumentPreview.js`.

**Expected:** Both guard on `inFlightScopesRef` (a ref, always current), acquire before the first await, and release in a `finally`. Downloads use a `download:` prefixed key so a download and a revise on the same scope are tracked independently and never block each other.

### R-015 | area: preview-ai | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** The Ask AI button opens a chat the user can actually see. ChatPanel sits at z-index 1100 and MUI dialogs default to 1300.

**Steps:**
1. Read the Ask AI handler in `app/components/DocumentPreviewDialog.js` and its wiring in `app/page.js`.

**Expected:** The handler commits any pending edit, then closes the preview, then opens the chat. ChatPanel's z-index is NOT raised globally. The pinned context carries the company, role, which document, the document text, and `sourceJobId` so the existing refresh effect keeps it current.

### R-016 | area: tailoring-metadata | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** A resume-only revise must not null out the cover letter's stored framing metadata. This was a pre-existing bug.

**Steps:**
1. Read the metadata write block near the end of `resubmitDocumentPreview` in `app/hooks/useDocumentPreview.js`.

**Expected:** `focusInfo`, `keywordsInfo`, `personaInfo` and `coverVariantInfo` are each written only when the call actually touched that scope. A resume-only revise leaves `coverVariantInfo` untouched rather than overwriting it with null.

### R-017 | area: persistence | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** Interactively generated cover letters persist. Previously only the automated queue ever wrote a cover letter row, so a browser-generated letter was lost on reload.

**Steps:**
1. Search the repo for callers of `saveGeneratedCoverLetter` and of `persistGeneratedDocuments`.

**Expected:** Every interactive generate path in `app/page.js` persists the cover letter when one was generated, via the shared helper in `lib/supabase/persistGeneration.js`. The helper never writes `docx_path` for cover letters, because `generated_cover_letters` has no such column.

### R-018 | area: persistence | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** Auto-save must never write database rows. It fires on a 600ms debounce while typing; persisting there would create hundreds of rows per session and make the version list unusable.

**Steps:**
1. Read `saveDocumentPreview` in `app/hooks/useDocumentPreview.js` in full.

**Expected:** Its body contains no Supabase client creation, no await, and no call to any persistence helper. Only regenerations persist.

### R-019 | area: persistence | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** The revise path must never write to the positions table. `upsertPosition` is a full-row upsert built for freshly scraped job objects and would null out location, salary, employment type, posted date and raw_data when called with partial preview data.

**Steps:**
1. Search `app/hooks/useDocumentPreview.js` for every access to the `positions` table.

**Expected:** Position access from this hook is read-only (`.select("id").eq("external_id", ...)`). There is no `upsert`, `insert`, `update` or `delete` against `positions` anywhere in the hook, and `upsertPosition` is not imported by it. The four generate flows in `app/page.js` legitimately still call `upsertPosition`, because they hold a complete job object.

### R-020 | area: version-history | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** Version history reads the append-only generation rows by position, newest first.

**Steps:**
1. Read `lib/supabase/documentVersions.js`.

**Expected:** The query selects from `generated_resumes` or `generated_cover_letters` per scope, filters on `position_id`, orders by `created_at` descending, and is capped with the reason documented. It returns an empty array on any error and never throws.

### R-021 | area: version-history | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** Selecting a version restores it as current content without losing in-progress typing, and the choice survives a reload.

**Steps:**
1. Read the version selection handler in `app/hooks/useDocumentPreview.js` and its `onSelect` wiring in `app/components/DocumentPreviewDialog.js`.

**Expected:** The handler flushes the pending auto-save (`commitDraft`) BEFORE switching. Selecting writes the version's content and lines for that scope only, sets that scope's `edited` to false, invalidates only that scope's cached render, and best-effort updates `applications.resume_used_id` or `cover_letter_id` so a reload restores the chosen version. The control is disabled only while its own scope is busy.

### R-022 | area: version-history | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** The version control degrades gracefully rather than showing an empty or broken selector.

**Steps:**
1. Read `app/components/preview/VersionControl.js`.

**Expected:** It renders nothing when there are fewer than two versions. Signed-out and no-position cases resolve to an empty version list upstream without console errors.

### R-023 | area: version-diff | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** Change classification is precise. Over-marking makes the highlight useless, so identical content must produce zero marks.

**Steps:**
1. From `hello-world`, run `npx vitest run lib/document/versionDiff.classifyLineChanges.test.js lib/document/versionDiff.markChangedParagraphs.test.js lib/document/versionDiff.markVersionChanges.test.js`.

**Expected:** All pass, including: identical inputs produce an empty result; an empty previous version produces an empty result (a first version must not mark everything); whitespace-only differences count as unchanged; an inserted line is marked without marking its neighbours; and the input render model is never mutated, with unaffected paragraphs returned by the same object reference.

### R-024 | area: version-diff | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** The shared HTML renderer stays byte-identical for documents with no highlights. Every preview, the combined download and the PDF path all flow through it.

**Steps:**
1. Read the run-style assembly in `renderModelToHtml` in `lib/document/docxPreview.js`.

**Expected:** The highlight entry is a conditional that yields an empty string when `mark` is absent, and the style array is filtered for falsy entries before joining. A model with no marks therefore produces exactly the previous output.

### R-025 | area: version-diff | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** Highlighting never fails silently on hand-edited documents. Those render from saved HTML and bypass the model entirely, so an annotated model would never be built.

**Steps:**
1. Read the highlight enablement logic in `app/components/DocumentPreviewDialog.js` and `app/components/preview/HighlightToggle.js`.

**Expected:** When a scope has saved edited HTML, the toggle is disabled and states why. It does not silently appear active while showing no highlights.

### R-026 | area: file-size | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** The project's 1000-line-per-file cap holds for every file touched by this work.

**Steps:**
1. From the repo root, run a line count over `hello-world/app/components/DocumentPreviewDialog.js`, `hello-world/app/components/preview/*.js`, `hello-world/app/hooks/useDocumentPreview.js`, `hello-world/lib/document/versionDiff.js`, `hello-world/lib/supabase/documentVersions.js`, `hello-world/lib/supabase/persistGeneration.js` and `hello-world/lib/tailor/previewScopes.js`.

**Expected:** Every one is under 1000 lines. Known pre-existing exception: `hello-world/app/page.js` is over 3000 lines and is being reduced by a separate consolidation effort; this work only added minimal prop wiring to it.

### R-027 | area: preview-concurrency | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** Hand edits to one document survive a regeneration of the other. The `edited` flag was entry-wide, so editing the cover letter and then regenerating the resume silently made the cover letter download serve a stale pre-edit document while the preview still showed the edits.

**Steps:**
1. Search the whole repo (`app` and `lib`) for reads of `.edited`.
2. Read the `editedForScope` helper and its callers in `app/hooks/useDocumentPreview.js`, `app/hooks/useCompanyResearch.js`, `app/page.js`, `lib/document/docx.js` and `app/components/StatusBar.js`.

**Expected:** `edited` is a per-scope object `{ resume, cover }`. EVERY read is scope-indexed through a helper; no bare `if (entry.edited)` or `!entry.edited` survives anywhere, because an object is always truthy and a bare check would silently invert behavior. A resume regeneration clears only `edited.resume`; a cover-letter hand edit sets only `edited.cover`; the company-research weave sets only the cover scope. A legacy boolean value is tolerated and read as edited on both scopes, which is the safe direction because it forces a rebuild rather than a stale verbatim serve.

### R-010 | area: cover-letter-quality | parallel-safe: no | automatable: no

**Summary:** End to end, a generated cover letter visibly reflects the tailored resume's emphasis and reads as letter prose rather than restated resume bullets.

**Steps:**
1. Sign in to the running app with a Gemini engine selection and a configured API key.
2. Tailor a resume and cover letter against a real posting.
3. Read the resulting letter against the tailored resume.

**Expected:** The letter's substance tracks the tailored resume's achievements and vocabulary, keeps the template's paragraph count and rhythm, and contains no fabricated employer, title, date, or metric. Requires a human read and a live API key, so it cannot be automated; record the outcome manually when run.

### R-028 | area: hiring-email | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** The hiring email is a third preview scope that is never treated as a .docx. A plain-text scope must never be pulled into the docx build, download, edit, or combine paths, all of which would silently produce a wrong or corrupt document.

**Steps:**
1. Read `hello-world/lib/tailor/documentScopes.js`.
2. Search `hello-world/app` for every use of `SCOPES` and `DOCX_SCOPES`.
3. Read the `canCombine`, `steeringEnabled`, Preview/Edit toggle, file-name row, `EditorToolbar` and Download/Copy branches in `hello-world/app/components/DocumentPreviewDialog.js`, the scope loop in `hello-world/app/components/preview/CombineDocumentsControl.js`, and `buildPreviewBlob` in `hello-world/app/hooks/useDocumentPreview.js`.

**Expected:** `SCOPES` is `["resume","cover","email"]` and `DOCX_SCOPES` is `["resume","cover"]`, defined once in `documentScopes.js` with no duplicate local copies anywhere. Tabs and content availability iterate `SCOPES`. Every docx-producing or docx-editing path iterates or gates on `DOCX_SCOPES`: combine, the Preview/Edit toggle, the editor toolbar, the file-name row, and the revise/steering strip. `buildPreviewBlob("email")` returns null so the email always renders through the plain-text model. The email tab's primary action is Copy, never Download .docx.

### R-029 | area: hiring-email | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** What the email preview displays and what the Copy button puts on the clipboard are the same text. These drifted apart trivially when each side formatted the subject itself.

**Steps:**
1. Read `emailPreviewLines` / `emailPreviewText` in `hello-world/lib/tailor/documentScopes.js`.
2. Confirm the preview render path (`loadPreviewModel` in `app/hooks/useDocumentPreview.js`) and the `copyEmail` handler in `DocumentPreviewDialog.js` both source their text from those helpers.
3. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism lib/tailor/documentScopes.emailPreviewLines.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** Both the renderer and the copy control go through the shared helpers, neither formats the subject itself. A present subject renders as `Subject: <text>` then a lone blank line then the body; an absent, empty, or whitespace-only subject yields the body alone with no `Subject:` line. A missing entry or a non-array body yields an empty result rather than throwing. The returned array is a copy, never an alias of `entry.emailResultLines`. Tests pass.

### R-030 | area: hiring-email | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** The email is addressed to a hiring committee, matching this repo's cover-letter convention. It previously opened with an unaddressed run-on sentence.

**Steps:**
1. Read `buildHiringEmailText` in `hello-world/lib/llm/engines/tailor-lite/engine.js`.
2. Read `buildHiringEmailPrompt` in `hello-world/lib/llm/tailorResume.js`.
3. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism lib/llm/engines/tailor-lite/buildHiringEmailText.test.js lib/llm/buildHiringEmailPrompt.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** The embedded builder's `bodyLines[0]` is exactly `Dear Hiring Committee,` as its own line, never merged into the intro sentence, and no line begins with `Hello, `. The sign-off is two lines when a name exists (`Best regards,` then the name alone); one bare `Best regards,` line when no name exists. Every emitted line is non-empty and already trimmed. The Gemini prompt instructs the same salutation as the first body line and a sign-off followed by the candidate's name, while keeping every pre-existing hard constraint: JSON-only output shape, single-line subject, no embedded newlines, and no fabrication. Tests pass.

### R-031 | area: hiring-email | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** The email never claims a capability the candidate's own library cannot back up. Sourcing the claims from the posting alone would fabricate skills.

**Steps:**
1. Read `topMatchingCapabilities` in `hello-world/lib/llm/engines/tailor-lite/engine.js`.
2. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism lib/llm/engines/tailor-lite/topMatchingCapabilities.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** Returned capabilities are the intersection of the posting's keywords and `candidateUniverse(...)` built from the candidate's own skill groups, so a posting keyword absent from the library is never returned. The `topic` category (RAKE-lite advisory phrases) is excluded. Results are deduplicated, ordered by descending score with a stable alphabetical tiebreak, and capped at the requested limit. Tests pass.

### R-032 | area: hiring-email | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** A failure to generate the email never fails the whole tailoring request, and an engine that cannot produce one degrades quietly. The email is the last of three documents; an unguarded throw here would discard an already-generated resume and cover letter.

**Steps:**
1. Read the `tailorHiringEmail` block in `hello-world/app/api/tailor/route.js`.
2. Read `tailorHiringEmail` in `hello-world/lib/llm/engines/externalEngine.js` and the registry comment in `hello-world/lib/llm/engines/index.js`.
3. Read the `emailResultLines` guard in the post-payload hook in `hello-world/app/hooks/useDocumentPreview.js`.

**Expected:** The route calls `tailorHiringEmail` only when the active engine implements it, wraps the call in try/catch, and on error records `emailError` and returns the resume and cover letter normally. The external engine resolves to null rather than throwing, and a null draft leaves the email fields empty rather than crashing. On a revise or focus change, an empty `emailResultLines` in the response never wipes a previously generated email; only a non-empty array replaces it.

### R-033 | area: hiring-email | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** The email scope does not break the preview controls that assume a docx-backed document with saved version history.

**Steps:**
1. Read the `VersionControl` and `HighlightToggle` render conditions in `hello-world/app/components/DocumentPreviewDialog.js`, and the early returns in both components under `hello-world/app/components/preview/`.
2. Read `lockScopesFor` and `changedScopes` in `hello-world/lib/tailor/previewScopes.js`.
3. Confirm switching tabs resets the editor mode.

**Expected:** With no saved versions for the email scope, `VersionControl` returns null (fewer than two versions) and `HighlightToggle` returns null (no previous version), so neither renders a broken control on the email tab. `lockScopesFor` never returns `email`, since the email is regenerated with the documents rather than revised on its own. Changing tabs sets the mode back to `view`, so edit mode cannot leak onto the read-only email tab.

### R-034 | area: copilot-audio | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** The interviewer's audio source is selectable, and anything unrecognized degrades to the browser-tab path rather than throwing. Tab sharing was the only source before this option existed, so an unrecognized value must never break a session that used to work.

**Steps:**
1. Read `THEM_CAPTURE_BY_SOURCE` and the `CopilotSession` constructor in `hello-world/lib/copilot/session.js`.
2. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism lib/copilot/session.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** `source: "system"` selects `captureSystemAudio`; `source: "tab"`, an omitted `source`, and an unrecognized value all select `captureTabAudio`. The constructor never throws on a bad source. The "them" source is still captured before the mic prompt, so its picker appears first.

### R-035 | area: copilot-audio | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** System-audio capture requests the constraints Chrome actually needs, and fails with instructions specific to that path. A generic or tab-worded error here sends the user to the wrong checkbox in the share dialog.

**Steps:**
1. Read `captureSystemAudio` in `hello-world/lib/copilot/capture.js`.
2. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism lib/copilot/capture.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** `getDisplayMedia` is called with `systemAudio: "include"`, `monitorTypeSurfaces: "include"`, and a `monitor` `displaySurface`, plus the shared raw-signal audio constraints (echoCancellation, noiseSuppression and autoGainControl all false). When the granted stream has no audio track, EVERY track is stopped before throwing, so no share indicator is left lit. When the shared surface was the whole screen, the thrown message names "Entire Screen" and "Share system audio" and states honestly that Chrome cannot capture system audio on macOS. The other surfaces get their own wording -- see R-039.

### R-036 | area: copilot-audio | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** Adding the system-audio option did not change tab capture. Tab sharing is the default and the only path that works on macOS, so a silent change here would break the majority path.

**Steps:**
1. Read `captureTabAudio` and the shared `DISPLAY_AUDIO_CONSTRAINTS` / `requireAudioTrack` helpers in `hello-world/lib/copilot/capture.js`.
2. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism lib/copilot/capture.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** `captureTabAudio` still requests `video: true` (Chrome will not grant tab audio without a video track) with the same three raw-signal audio constraints, and still throws the tab-specific message naming a browser tab and "Share tab audio" -- not the system-audio wording. The two capture paths share one constraints constant and one no-audio-track guard so they cannot drift apart.

### R-037 | area: copilot-audio | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** The source control cannot change under a running session, and the choice survives a reload. Switching source mid-session would leave the UI describing a source the live Deepgram streams are not using.

**Steps:**
1. Read the `ToggleButtonGroup`, `onSourceChange`, the `SOURCE_STORAGE_KEY` seeding effect, and the `shareInstructions` text in `hello-world/app/copilot/CopilotClient.js`.
2. Confirm `source` is passed to `new CopilotSession(...)` and is in the `start` callback's dependency array.

**Expected:** The control is disabled whenever status is `live` or `connecting`. `onSourceChange` ignores a null value (an exclusive ToggleButtonGroup emits null when the active button is clicked again), so the selection can never be cleared. The choice is stored under `copilot-audio-source`, which is a different key from `copilot-prep-context`; reads and writes are wrapped in try/catch and an unrecognized stored value falls back to `tab`. The instructional paragraph names Entire Screen and "Share system audio" for the system option and the meeting tab for the tab option.

### R-038 | area: copilot-audio | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** Session teardown and failure semantics are unchanged by the new source option. The mic has always been optional and the interviewer source fatal; inverting either would either kill working sessions or leave a session silently transcribing nothing.

**Steps:**
1. Read `start`, `_addSource` and `stop` in `hello-world/lib/copilot/session.js`.
2. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism lib/copilot/session.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** A failure of the "them" capture (tab or system) rejects out of `start()` and is fatal. A mic failure is soft: it reports through onError and the session continues with interviewer audio only. Each source still gets its own PcmPipeline and DeepgramStream, which is what provides speaker separation without diarization. The first audio track of every source still gets an "ended" listener so the browser's native "Stop sharing" tears the session down.

### R-039 | area: copilot-audio | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** When system-audio capture yields no audio, the error names the mistake the user actually made. `displaySurface: "monitor"` is advisory per spec and cannot restrict the picker, so the user can still land on a window or a tab -- and the original message told every one of them to tick a "Share system audio" checkbox that Chrome never shows for those surfaces.

**Steps:**
1. Read `readDisplaySurface`, `buildSystemAudioMessage`, `SYSTEM_AUDIO_MESSAGES_BY_SURFACE` and `requireAudioTrack` in `hello-world/lib/copilot/capture.js`.
2. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism lib/copilot/capture.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** The video track's `getSettings().displaySurface` is read BEFORE any track is stopped, since a stopped track's settings may be cleared. A `window` surface produces a message saying a window share carries no system audio on Windows and to pick "Entire Screen" instead, and it must NOT tell the user to turn on a "Share system audio" checkbox. A `browser` surface produces a message pointing at this app's own "Browser tab" interviewer-audio option. A `monitor` surface, an unrecognized surface, a missing `getSettings`, a `getSettings` that throws, a stream with no video track, and a stream that does not implement `getVideoTracks` at all ALL fall back to the whole-screen wording rather than raising a TypeError. In every one of these failure cases every granted track still has `stop()` called exactly once.

### R-040 | area: practice-capture | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** Practice mode captures the candidate's own camera and mic, and a camera failure degrades to microphone-only without blaming the wrong device. `getUserMedia` is atomic, so a combined request also rejects when the MICROPHONE is the problem, and the old wording blamed the camera for that.

**Steps:**
1. Read `captureCameraAndMic` and the shared `MIC_AUDIO_CONSTRAINTS` in `hello-world/lib/copilot/capture.js`.
2. Read `start()` in `hello-world/lib/copilot/practiceSession.js`.
3. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism lib/copilot/capture.test.js lib/copilot/practiceSession.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** `captureCameraAndMic` requests 720p-ideal front-facing video plus the processed mic constraints, and `captureMicAudio`'s own argument is unchanged by the extraction of that shared constant. A granted stream with no audio track has every track stopped before a microphone-specific error is thrown. The soft "Camera unavailable (...). Continuing with microphone only." warning is emitted ONLY after the mic-only fallback actually succeeds; when the fallback also fails, the ORIGINAL combined-request error propagates and no camera-blaming warning is emitted.

### R-041 | area: practice-capture | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** A Stop that lands while the session is still connecting leaves nothing running. Without the guard this leaked a billed Deepgram socket and a live AudioContext, and repainted the UI as live with the session unreachable.

**Steps:**
1. Read `start()` and `stop()` in `hello-world/lib/copilot/practiceSession.js`, specifically where `_dg` and `_pipeline` are assigned relative to their awaits and where `_stopped` is re-checked.
2. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism lib/copilot/practiceSession.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** `_dg` and `_pipeline` are assigned to the instance BEFORE their `connect()` / `start()` are awaited, and `_stopped` is re-checked after every await. A `stop()` during the Deepgram handshake, and a `stop()` during the AudioWorklet load, each end with the socket closed, the pipeline stopped, every track stopped, and a final status of `idle`. A late `open` arriving after teardown never repaints the status to `live` — every callback forwarded from the socket is swallowed once `_stopped` is set.

### R-042 | area: practice-capture | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** A Deepgram socket that closes on its own tears the capture down for real. Reporting `idle` while the camera and mic kept running left the user with a lit camera indicator and no Stop button.

**Steps:**
1. Read the `onStatus` handler passed to `DeepgramStream` in `hello-world/lib/copilot/practiceSession.js`.
2. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism lib/copilot/practiceSession.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** An unsolicited `closed` while the session is running calls `stop()`, so every track is stopped and the status reaches `idle` — it is not a cosmetic status change. A `closed` arriving as a result of the app's own `stop()` does not recurse. The video track's `ended` listener flips `hasVideo` false and re-publishes through `onStream` WITHOUT stopping the session, since audio-only is a valid state; the audio track's `ended` listener does tear the session down.

### R-043 | area: copilot-audio | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** `PcmPipeline` closes an AudioContext whose worklet load was interrupted by a concurrent stop. This affects the LIVE interview path as well as practice mode — before the fix, any Stop racing the module load leaked a running AudioContext for the life of the page.

**Steps:**
1. Read `PcmPipeline.start()` and `PcmPipeline.stop()` in `hello-world/lib/copilot/capture.js`.
2. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism lib/copilot/capture.test.js lib/copilot/practiceSession.test.js lib/copilot/session.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** `this.ctx` is assigned immediately after the AudioContext is constructed, BEFORE `addModule` is awaited, so a concurrent `stop()` always has something to close. `start()` re-checks its stopped flag after that await and returns without building the node graph when it is set, so `createMediaStreamSource` is never called on a closed context and no spurious error surfaces to a user who pressed Stop. The flag resets at the top of `start()` so the instance stays reusable.

### R-044 | area: copilot-audio | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** The live interview session can never be stranded by leaving its view. The mode toggle keys off the session's existence rather than its status, because `status === "error"` leaves a `CopilotSession` holding the screen share and mic while the UI already shows "Start session".

**Steps:**
1. Read `onModeChange` and the unmount-cleanup effect in `hello-world/app/copilot/CopilotClient.js`.
2. Confirm the mode `ToggleButtonGroup` ignores a null value and is disabled while the live session is running.

**Expected:** Switching to practice mode stops any existing live session first, keyed on `sessionRef.current` existing rather than on `status`. Unmounting `CopilotClient` (switching main tabs in `app/page.js`) also stops the session, mirroring `PracticeClient`. Nothing about the audio-source toggle, the `copilot-audio-source` storage key, the share-instruction wording, the `CopilotSession` wiring or the question/answer flow is changed by this — R-034 through R-039 all still hold.

### R-045 | area: practice-postings | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** The practice posting picker offers exactly the rows the Tracking table shows, and a failed load is never reported to the user as an empty account.

**Steps:**
1. Read `fetchPracticePostings` and `normalizePostingRows` in `hello-world/lib/copilot/postings.js`, and compare the query against `loadApplications` in `hello-world/app/page.js`.
2. Read the `noOptionsText` and helper-text branches in `hello-world/app/copilot/practice/PostingPicker.js`.
3. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism lib/copilot/postings.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** The query is `applications` joined to `positions`, filtered to the signed-in user, excluding statuses `tracking` and `auto_tailored`, ordered by `applied_at` descending. Rows with no joined position, or with neither a title nor a company, are dropped; duplicates on title+company collapse case-insensitively keeping the newest; a row with a missing or unparseable `applied_at` is still included and merely sorts last. Signed out returns an empty list without querying, while an auth-lookup error and a query error are each thrown so the picker can show them. When the load fails, the dropdown says the load failed — it must NOT say the user has no tracked postings.

### R-046 | area: practice-questions | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** The deterministic question bank is genuinely deterministic, never empty, and never repeats a question the session already asked.

**Steps:**
1. Read `buildQuestionBank` and `nextPracticeQuestion` in `hello-world/lib/copilot/practiceQuestions.js`.
2. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism lib/copilot/practiceQuestions.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** No `Math.random`, no `Date`; the same posting and asked-list always yield the same next question and the same wording. The bank is non-empty for a null, undefined, empty or whitespace-only posting. Technical questions are built from terms extracted from the posting's own description, falling back to a generic technical set when nothing is extractable. Types interleave rather than grouping. Dedupe runs through `normalizeQuestion`, tolerates non-strings and empty entries in the asked list, and a fully consumed bank returns exactly `{ question: "", type: "general", exhausted: true }`.

### R-047 | area: practice-questions | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** The question route serves all three engine paths without ever dead-ending a practice session, and its asked-list cap keeps the questions most likely to be repeated.

**Steps:**
1. Read `app/api/copilot/question/route.js` in `hello-world/`.
2. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism app/api/copilot/question/route.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** No signed-in user returns 401 with "Sign in to use the interview copilot.". The embedded engine answers from the deterministic bank with `source: "embedded"` and never constructs a Gemini client. A Gemini throw, an unparseable response, an empty question, or a question duplicating one already asked all fall back to the bank and report `source: "fallback"` — never a 5xx, and never silently. `sanitizeAsked` keeps the MOST RECENT entries at the cap, not the first ones, and the anti-repeat comparison truncates the candidate the same way the stored entries were truncated. The response shape is identical across all three paths.

### R-048 | area: practice-answer | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** An answer contains the words the candidate actually spoke between Start and Done — bounded by AUDIO time, not by when the transcript happened to arrive. Bounding by arrival time dropped the closing sentence of every answer and attributed pre-Start speech to it.

**Steps:**
1. Read `isFinalInAnswerWindow` and `deriveSpeechSpan` in `hello-world/lib/copilot/answerWindow.js`.
2. Read the `start`/`duration` passthrough in `hello-world/lib/copilot/deepgram.js` and the drain in `doneAnswer` in `hello-world/app/copilot/practice/usePracticeAnswer.js`.
3. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism lib/copilot/answerWindow.test.js lib/copilot/deepgram.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** A final whose audio start precedes the answer's start offset is excluded. While the end offset is still null — the answer is in progress or draining — a final at or after the start offset is included, which is what catches the last sentence still in flight when Done is pressed. `doneAnswer` does not close the window synchronously; it drains for a bounded period so a lost socket can never hang the UI. `deepgram.js`'s `start` and `duration` are additive: the pre-existing `speaker`, `transcript`, `isFinal` and `speechFinal` fields are unchanged in name and value, non-Results frames and empty transcripts are still ignored, and the live copilot path is unaffected.

### R-049 | area: practice-answer | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** Pace is computed over the span the words actually cover, not the button-to-button wall clock, and no delivery number is ever `NaN` or `Infinity`.

**Steps:**
1. Read `computeAnswerMetrics` in `hello-world/lib/copilot/answerMetrics.js`.
2. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism lib/copilot/answerMetrics.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** `wordsPerMinute` is derived from `speechDurationMs`, not from the wall-clock `durationMs`; both are reported, and the UI shows them as separate rows so they are never conflated. Zero, missing or negative durations produce 0 wpm rather than Infinity or NaN, and empty text returns zeros throughout. `hasMetric` delegates to `profileMetric` rather than duplicating the regex, and `micMuted` is carried through so the review can say the mic was off.

### R-050 | area: practice-answer | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** A camera the candidate switched off is reported as off, not measured as a dark, motionless shot. The Camera control sets `track.enabled = false`, which leaves the track in the stream emitting black frames.

**Steps:**
1. Read `isTrackActive`, the sampling guard, and how `hadVideo` and `partiallyOff` are derived in `VideoFrameSampler` in `hello-world/lib/copilot/videoStats.js`.
2. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism lib/copilot/videoStats.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** Sampling is skipped while the video track is disabled or muted, and `hadVideo` is derived from whether any VALID sample was captured — not from track presence. A camera off for the whole answer reports `hadVideo: false` and produces no lighting or steadiness claim at all. A camera off for part of the answer sets `partiallyOff`, which the review states, while the valid samples still produce honest numbers. No sample is taken while the offscreen video reports zero dimensions or a readyState below HAVE_CURRENT_DATA.

### R-051 | area: practice-answer | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** A measurement flag that is false for lack of data is never presented as a finding. This is the difference between "we measured it and it was fine" and "we could not measure it".

**Steps:**
1. Read `summarizeVideoStats` and the `MIN_LUMA_SAMPLES` / `MIN_MOTION_SAMPLES` gates in `hello-world/lib/copilot/videoStats.js`.
2. Read `buildDeliveryNotes` and `computeDeliveryScore` in `hello-world/lib/copilot/critiqueLocal.js`.
3. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism lib/copilot/videoStats.test.js lib/copilot/critiqueLocal.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** Empty or missing input returns `frames: 0`, `motionSamples: 0` and every flag false with no NaN. `veryStill` and `fidgety` cannot fire below the motion-sample gate — a single-sample answer must never claim the candidate was very still. `tooDark` and `tooBright` cannot fire below the luma gate. No lighting claim is emitted without luma samples and no steadiness claim without motion samples, and no visual claim of any kind when `hadVideo` is false. When nothing about delivery was measurable, the delivery component is excluded and the remaining weights renormalized rather than scored zero and blamed in the verdict.

### R-052 | area: practice-answer | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** Filler counting does not overstate. Ambiguous words are counted separately from true fillers, and no filler matches inside a larger or hyphenated word.

**Steps:**
1. Read `FILLER_PHRASES`, `DISCOURSE_MARKER_PHRASES` and `phraseRegex` in `hello-world/lib/copilot/answerMetrics.js`.
2. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism lib/copilot/answerMetrics.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** Um, uh, er, "you know", "sort of", "kind of" and "I mean" count as fillers. Like, right, actually, basically and literally are counted and displayed SEPARATELY as discourse markers that may be legitimate usage — they are not folded into the filler count. "unlike" never counts "like" and "right-hand" never counts "right": the boundary handling excludes letters, digits and hyphens on both sides. `fillerRate` is per 100 words and is 0 when there are no words.

### R-053 | area: practice-answer | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** The replay recorder never blocks answering and never mixes one answer's video into another's clip.

**Steps:**
1. Read `pickSupportedMimeType` and the `AnswerRecorder` class in `hello-world/lib/copilot/answerRecorder.js`.
2. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism lib/copilot/answerRecorder.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** With `MediaRecorder` missing or no supported mime type, `start()` is a no-op and `stop()` resolves null — replay is a bonus and its absence never blocks answering or the metrics. `stop()` ALWAYS settles: with a Blob on the stop event, and with null when unsupported, when nothing was recording, when no chunks arrived, or when the guard timeout elapses first. Each recording's `dataavailable` listener is bound to its OWN chunk array, so a chunk flushed late by a previous recorder cannot land in the next answer's clip. `stop()` is safe twice and without a matching `start()`; a throwing constructor or `start()` degrades to the no-op path.

### R-054 | area: practice-critique | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** The critique response contract is enforced by the server on every path, and the engine that produced a critique is reported truthfully.

**Steps:**
1. Read `sanitizeCritique`, `sanitizeStar` and the branch structure in `hello-world/app/api/copilot/critique/route.js`.
2. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism app/api/copilot/critique/route.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** `source` is always set by the server from the path actually taken and is never read from the model, so a Gemini response claiming `source: "embedded"` cannot survive. `star` is null unless the question type is behavioral, on both paths. The score is clamped to an integer 0-100 and the arrays are capped, so no unexpected field from the model reaches the client. The response shape is identical across the embedded, Gemini and fallback paths.

### R-055 | area: practice-critique | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** The critique never dead-ends and never leaks camera frames to a path that should not have them.

**Steps:**
1. Read the `wantsEmbedded` branch, `sanitizeFrames`, and the fallback handling in `hello-world/app/api/copilot/critique/route.js`.
2. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism app/api/copilot/critique/route.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** No signed-in user returns 401. The embedded engine returns the deterministic critique, never constructs a Gemini client, and never parses frames at all. Frames reach Gemini only on the non-embedded path, and a non-JPEG data URL, a payload that is not decodable base64, a non-string entry, and anything past the third frame are all dropped. A Gemini throw, an unparseable response, and malformed client metrics all still return a usable critique rather than a 5xx — inputs are normalized once, before either branch, so the fallback cannot fail the same way the primary did.

### R-056 | area: practice-critique | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** The deterministic rubric — what a no-API-key deploy runs — states nothing about the candidate's answer that it did not measure, and never contradicts itself.

**Steps:**
1. Read `RESULT_PHRASE_RE` / `RESULT_METRIC_RE`, `SITUATION_RE`, `TECH_TRADEOFF_RE`, `structureStrengthText`, the posting-overlap term matching, and the relevance boilerplate filter in `hello-world/lib/copilot/critiqueLocal.js`.
2. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism lib/copilot/critiqueLocal.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** A quantified result is detected anywhere in a sentence — "Support tickets fell by 40% after the change." and "It generated $250,000 in new revenue." both set the result beat. "A complete STAR story" is claimed only when all four beats are present, never alongside a `missing` entry naming an absent beat. "I looked at the logs" does not credit a Situation beat, and a bare "however" or "although" does not credit a trade-off. Posting-vocabulary overlap matches on word boundaries with a minimum canonical length, so short taxonomy entries cannot match inside unrelated words and manufacture a strength. Interview-question boilerplate is stripped before relevance overlap, so a directly responsive answer is not told it drifted. The rubric is fully deterministic — identical inputs give an identical score AND identical wording — and the score stays an integer within 0-100 for an empty answer, a one-word answer, a 2000-word answer and an all-filler answer. An empty answer returns a low score, an honest verdict, empty strengths, and asserts nothing about prose that does not exist.

### R-057 | area: practice-privacy | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: no

**Summary:** The practice screen never tells the candidate their camera data stays local while it is being uploaded, and consent for frames is read at send time rather than latched.

**Steps:**
1. Read `framesWillUpload`, `privacyNotice` and `onRetryCritique` in `hello-world/app/copilot/practice/PracticeClient.js`.
2. Read `runCritique` and `retryCritique` in `hello-world/app/copilot/practice/usePracticeAnswer.js`, noting what `lastCritiqueInputsRef` does and does not hold.
3. Read the practice-mode description in `hello-world/app/copilot/CopilotClient.js`.

**Expected:** The frames opt-in defaults to off and is disabled on the embedded engine. Frames are read from the retained frame ref at SEND time using the current opt-in, and are deliberately not part of the cached retry inputs — so turning the switch off and pressing Retry sends no frames. The privacy notice is derived from the current engine and switch state and names every real destination: audio to Deepgram always; on the Gemini engine the answer transcript, posting details and prep context to Google, plus up to three still frames only when the switch is on; the embedded engine sends nothing to Google; the recorded replay clip is never uploaded under any setting. No wording promises the video stays in the browser while frames are in flight.

### R-058 | area: practice-critique | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: no

**Summary:** The shared prep context behaves like one value across both copilot views, and a deliberate deletion sticks.

**Steps:**
1. Read `usePrepContext` in `hello-world/app/copilot/usePrepContext.js`, specifically the listener store, the fallback latch, and how a stored empty string is distinguished from a never-written key.
2. Confirm `CopilotClient` wraps the setter only to clear its answer cache, and that the cache-clearing logic is not inside the hook.

**Expected:** The `/api/user-context` fallback runs at most once per mount and is not re-fired by the stored value changing, so clearing the textarea does not silently refill it from the account's saved context. The hook is a real external store — a module-level listener set, a subscribe that registers and unregisters, and a setter that notifies after writing — so an edit in practice mode is immediately visible to the live view mounted alongside it, and neither can overwrite the other with a stale value. Storage access stays wrapped in try/catch and the live path keeps the same storage key, the same fallback and the same answer-cache clearing on edit.

### R-059 | area: practice-answer | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: no

**Summary:** No browser resource outlives the answer that created it. Every abandonment path finalizes the recorder and the sampler, and exactly one replay object URL exists at a time.

**Steps:**
1. Read `abandonInProgressAnswer`, `resetAnswerState`, the object-URL handling, and the generation guard in `hello-world/app/copilot/practice/usePracticeAnswer.js`.
2. Confirm every caller — posting change, next question, try again, session stop, the session's own unsolicited teardown, and unmount — goes through them.

**Expected:** Changing the posting, moving to the next question, retrying, stopping the session, an unsolicited teardown, and unmounting all finalize an in-progress answer: the sampler interval and its offscreen video are released, the recorder is stopped, and the pending drain is resolved rather than left hanging. The replay object URL is revoked before a new one replaces it and on every discard path. Post-await writes are dropped when their captured generation is stale, so a finished answer's review cannot land under a different question. The mic-muted flag is seeded from the current switch state at answer start, not only from a toggle fired mid-recording.

### R-060 | area: practice-history | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** The practice-answer history table is owner-scoped and shaped so a partial save is still a valid row. The video itself lives in the existing `resumes` bucket, which already owner-scopes `${user_id}/...`, so no new bucket or storage policy exists to get wrong.

**Steps:**
1. Read `hello-world/supabase/migrations/20260805000000_practice_answers.sql`.
2. Compare its conventions against `hello-world/supabase/migrations/20260703000000_tailor_personas.sql`.
3. Read the storage path built in `hello-world/lib/supabase/practiceAnswers.js`.

**Expected:** `user_id` references `auth.users (id) on delete cascade`; `application_id` references `public.applications (id) on delete set null` and has its own index; every text and jsonb column has a not-null default so a critique-less or video-less save is still valid, while `duration_ms` and `video_bytes` are nullable because null honestly means unknown. There is an index on `(user_id, created_at desc)` matching the history query. RLS is enabled with owner-scoped policies for select, insert, update and delete, plus explicit grants. The migration is idempotent. Clips are written to `${userId}/practice/` in the pre-existing `resumes` bucket — no new bucket and no new storage policy are introduced.

### R-061 | area: practice-history | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** Saving an answer never silently loses it, and never claims to have kept a recording it did not keep.

**Steps:**
1. Read `savePracticeAnswer` in `hello-world/lib/supabase/practiceAnswers.js`.
2. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism lib/supabase/practiceAnswers.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** The storage path and the inserted row id agree, and the extension follows the recorded mime type. With no blob at all the row is still inserted with an empty `video_path` AND a note saying there was no recording, so the caller can tell that apart from a saved video. A blob over the size cap is not uploaded but the rest of the answer is still saved, with the cap reported. An upload failure inserts no row. An insert failure after a successful upload removes the uploaded object, and a cleanup that itself fails is reported rather than leaving a silent orphan. A foreign-key violation on `application_id` is retried once with null, so a posting deleted mid-session never costs the user the whole answer. The generated id is a valid uuid even without `crypto.randomUUID`.

### R-062 | area: practice-history | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** Deleting a saved answer either fully succeeds or leaves the entry intact so it can be retried. The row is the only pointer to the storage object, so deleting it first strands a video the user can never reach again.

**Steps:**
1. Read `deletePracticeAnswer` in `hello-world/lib/supabase/practiceAnswers.js`.
2. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism lib/supabase/practiceAnswers.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** The storage object is removed BEFORE the row, and the tests assert that ORDER rather than only that both happened. When the object removal fails the row is NOT deleted and the message says the entry was kept and can be retried. An object that is already gone counts as success and the row is still deleted. A row-delete failure after the object was removed is reported and invites a retry. A missing row, another user's row, a missing id and a signed-out caller are each errors, never thrown exceptions.

### R-063 | area: practice-history | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** The history lists the user's own answers, never mints playback links it does not need, and admits when it has truncated.

**Steps:**
1. Read `listPracticeAnswers`, `signedVideoUrl` and `updatePracticeAnswerCritique` in `hello-world/lib/supabase/practiceAnswers.js`.
2. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism lib/supabase/practiceAnswers.test.js lib/supabase/practiceAnswers.updatePracticeAnswerCritique.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** The list queries the signed-in user's rows newest first with the cap applied, and reports when the cap was hit so the UI can say the history is truncated. Signed out returns an empty list rather than an error. `signedVideoUrl` refuses an empty path instead of minting anything, and is called on demand rather than for every row at list time — the bucket is private, so a public URL is never an option. `updatePracticeAnswerCritique` is scoped to the signed-in user, so a critique that failed and was then successfully retried updates that row rather than leaving it permanently empty, and one user can never patch another's row.

### R-064 | area: practice-privacy | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: no

**Summary:** The practice screen's privacy notice is true in every combination of the three independent controls, and consent is read at send time rather than latched.

**Steps:**
1. Read `privacyNotice`, `framesWillUpload`, the save switch and `onRetryCritique` in `hello-world/app/copilot/practice/PracticeClient.js`.
2. Read `persistAnswer` and `runCritique` in `hello-world/app/copilot/practice/usePracticeAnswer.js`, noting how the save preference and the frames opt-in are each read.
3. Read the practice-mode description in `hello-world/app/copilot/CopilotClient.js`.

**Expected:** The save switch defaults on and the frames opt-in defaults off; they are independent controls with independent wording, and neither implies the other's behavior. The notice names every real destination for the current settings: audio to Deepgram always; on the Gemini engine the answer transcript, posting details and prep context to Google, plus up to three still frames only when the frames switch is on; the video to the user's own account storage only when saving is on, private to them and deletable from the history. Nothing anywhere still claims the video never leaves the browser while saving is enabled. Both the frames opt-in and the save preference are re-read immediately before the corresponding request, so turning either off mid-flight prevents that upload — neither is latched at Done.

### R-065 | area: body-language | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** The on-device body-language models are served locally and the vendored runtime's telemetry never leaves the browser. An on-device feature that phones home is not on-device.

**Steps:**
1. Read `hello-world/public/mediapipe/models/README.md` and `hello-world/scripts/copy-mediapipe.mjs`.
2. Read the model and wasm paths, and `isMediaPipeTelemetryUrl` plus the fetch guard, in `hello-world/lib/copilot/bodyLandmarks.js`.
3. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism lib/copilot/bodyLandmarks.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** The `.task` model files are committed under `public/mediapipe/models/` and loaded from that local path; the wasm runtime is staged from the installed package by the copy script rather than committed, so it stays version-locked, and the script asserts the exact files it must produce. No model or wasm is fetched from any CDN at runtime, and the build needs no network access. `@mediapipe/tasks-vision` 1.0.1 ships a telemetry POST to `odml.pa.googleapis.com` with no working opt-out (`enableLogging` is in its type definitions but absent from the shipped bundle), so a scoped guard answers that host locally; `isMediaPipeTelemetryUrl` matches that exact hostname and does NOT match look-alike hosts that merely contain it as a substring or subdomain prefix. The README records the model versions, hashes, licence and re-fetch commands.

### R-066 | area: body-language | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** Posture measurements are geometrically correct. Level shoulders read as level, and the same physical pose measures the same regardless of how close the person sits or what aspect ratio the camera has.

**Steps:**
1. Read `postureFrom` and its threshold constants in `hello-world/lib/copilot/bodyLanguage.js`.
2. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism lib/copilot/bodyLanguage.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** Landmark 11 is the subject's ANATOMICAL left shoulder, which in the unmirrored frame the sampler feeds MediaPipe sits at the LARGER image x. Perfectly level shoulders therefore must report a tilt near 0 and never near 180 — the tests build the fixture unmirrored and assert this explicitly, because the original implementation reported 180 for a level sitter and, since the true signal sat on atan2's branch cut, averaged a real wobble down to a fabricated 0. Tilt is symmetric with opposite signs when the lower shoulder swaps sides. Slouch is scale-invariant across distance from the camera, and tilt and slouch are aspect-ratio corrected so a 4:3 and a 16:9 frame agree. Shoulder tilt and lean depend only on the shoulder landmarks — a nose below the visibility threshold may null slouch alone.

### R-067 | area: body-language | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** No body-language figure is reported unless enough of the answer was actually visible. A percentage computed over a handful of detected frames is not a measurement of the answer.

**Steps:**
1. Read `summarizeBodyLanguage`, `MIN_COVERAGE_RATIO` and the per-signal sample minimums in `hello-world/lib/copilot/bodyLanguage.js`.
2. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism lib/copilot/bodyLanguage.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** An aggregate is null when the frames that produced it fall below `MIN_COVERAGE_RATIO` of ALL sampled ticks, not merely when an absolute count is unmet — a face detected in a handful of hundreds of ticks yields no confident percentage. Every derived value is null rather than 0 or false below its minimum, and the reported sample counts match the samples actually used. Head-movement deltas are taken only between genuinely consecutive ticks, so a gap where the camera was off or the face was lost does not manufacture movement. A fresh summary object is returned per call. Empty, single-sample and all-invalid input produce no NaN or Infinity anywhere.

### R-068 | area: body-language | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: no

**Summary:** The sampler reports why it could not measure, rather than reporting nothing as if it were a measurement of stillness.

**Steps:**
1. Read `BodyLanguageSampler` in `hello-world/lib/copilot/bodyLandmarks.js`: the failure reasons, the track-active check, the overrun guard, the model cache and `stop()`.
2. Read how `AnswerReview` renders the unavailable state and `partiallyOff`.

**Expected:** Each distinct failure — no camera, camera off, model load failed, no frames, not ready, inference failed, no samples — is reported as its own machine-readable reason, never swallowed into a silent zero. `hadVideo` derives from whether any VALID sample was captured, not from track presence, so a camera switched off for the whole answer reports as off rather than as a dark, motionless shot; a camera off for part of it sets `partiallyOff`, which the UI states. Sampling is skipped while the track is disabled or muted, and while the offscreen video reports zero dimensions or an insufficient readyState. A tick that overruns the interval is skipped rather than queued. The landmarkers are cached across answers, per-answer state is not, a failed load closes what it constructed and retries are bounded, and `stop()` is safe without `start()`, twice, and immediately after `start()`.

### R-069 | area: bl-feedback | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** Body-language feedback actually reaches the user. It is appended to a capped list, so without a reserved slot it is silently deleted and the panel then declares it unavailable for an answer that was measured and scored.

**Steps:**
1. Read `buildDeliveryNotes` in `hello-world/lib/copilot/critiqueLocal.js` and `sanitizeCritique` in `hello-world/app/api/copilot/critique/route.js`, specifically how the body-language line is budgeted against `MAX_LIST`.
2. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism lib/copilot/critiqueLocal.test.js app/api/copilot/critique/route.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** On the embedded path, an answer with a fully measured body-language summary AND a mic-muted note still returns the body-language note — the other notes are capped to `MAX_LIST - 1` first. On the Gemini path, a model response carrying a full set of delivery items PLUS a body-language line still delivers the body-language line. The body-language line has its own longer length clamp so a fully measured note is not truncated mid-sentence and does not lose its final fact. The note is identifiable by a prefix that tolerates common variants without double-prefixing.

### R-070 | area: bl-feedback | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** Turning the camera off costs the user nothing. An unmeasurable component is excluded and the weights renormalised, never scored zero and blamed.

**Steps:**
1. Read `computeBodyLanguageScore` in `hello-world/lib/copilot/critiqueBodyLanguage.js` and how `computeDeliveryScore` in `hello-world/lib/copilot/critiqueLocal.js` consumes it.
2. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism lib/copilot/critiqueBodyLanguage.test.js lib/copilot/critiqueLocal.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** `computeBodyLanguageScore` returns null, not zero, when nothing was measurable. An answer given with the camera off scores identically to an otherwise identical answer that never had a camera, asserted by comparing composite scores rather than internals. The composite stays an integer within 0-100 across no summary, an all-null summary, camera off and fully measured. The too-close and too-far framing penalties scale with their ratios rather than being flat deductions, and lean is scored in exactly one place rather than penalised twice.

### R-071 | area: bl-feedback | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** Every body-language sentence claims exactly what was measured and nothing more. This feature tells a person things about their own body, so the vocabulary is a correctness property.

**Steps:**
1. Read `buildBodyLanguageFacts`, `bodyLanguageDeliveryNote` and `normalizeBodyLanguage` in `hello-world/lib/copilot/critiqueBodyLanguage.js`, and `bodyLanguageInstruction` in `hello-world/app/api/copilot/critique/route.js`.
2. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism lib/copilot/critiqueBodyLanguage.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** A null aggregate produces no sentence at all, in either direction — it never becomes praise and never becomes criticism. Head orientation is described as facing the camera and never as eye contact, gaze or attention. Percentages state the visible-face denominator rather than implying whole-answer coverage, and `partiallyOff` adds a coverage caveat. Face fill is described as the face, not the person filling the frame. Hands out of frame is reported as not measured, never as stillness. No fact is emitted whose rounded percentage reads as 0. Ratios and angles are clamped, so a malformed client summary cannot print impossible values into either the user-facing note or the facts block sent to Gemini as ground truth. No emotion, confidence, nerves, personality or appearance vocabulary appears anywhere, including in the model instruction, which also forbids commenting on a signal absent from the supplied facts.

### R-072 | area: bl-feedback | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** The model cannot manufacture body-language content out of nothing, and the response contract is unchanged for existing consumers.

**Steps:**
1. Read `sanitizeCritique` and the `allowBodyLanguage` gate in `hello-world/app/api/copilot/critique/route.js`.
2. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism app/api/copilot/critique/route.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** When nothing was measured and no frames were sent, body-language content is dropped from the WHOLE delivery channel — not merely from the dedicated field — so a model that writes it into `delivery` instead cannot bypass the gate. The measured facts are supplied to the model as ground truth it is told not to contradict. The response still carries exactly its established key set, `source` is still set by the server from the path actually taken, `star` is still null unless the question is behavioral, the score is still clamped to an integer 0-100, and the embedded path still never constructs a Gemini client and never parses frames.

### R-073 | area: bl-feedback | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: no

**Summary:** The feedback panel says who actually looked at the video, and why body language is missing when it is.

**Steps:**
1. Read the provenance caption and the unavailable state in `hello-world/app/copilot/practice/AnswerFeedback.js`.
2. Read what `PracticeClient` passes it, specifically the frames-sent boolean and the body-language reason.

**Expected:** The caption keys on whether frames were ACTUALLY sent, not on which engine ran. With the frames opt-in off — the default — the Gemini path reads the same as the embedded path: measured numbers only, nobody reviewed the video. The Gemini-failed-and-fell-back case does not claim a visual review either. When body language is unavailable the panel states the specific reason carried from the sampler rather than a generic message, and never hides the section silently or renders empty rows. The panel's body-language feedback is distinct from the raw measurements `AnswerReview` shows on the same screen, and the two never contradict each other.

### R-074 | area: copilot-config | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** The copilot can open a session on a deploy with no Gemini key. Transcription is independent of the LLM, so requiring an LLM key to mint a transcription token was a coupling bug that made the whole copilot unusable on a keyless (embedded-engine) deploy.

**Steps:**
1. Read `getDeepgramApiKey` in `hello-world/lib/config/env.js` and confirm it does not go through `REQUIRED_SERVER_KEYS`.
2. Read `app/api/copilot/token/route.js` and confirm the order of the auth check and the configuration check.
3. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism lib/config/env.test.js app/api/copilot/token/route.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** With `Gemini_LLM_API_Key` unset and the selected provider's key set, a signed-in POST mints a token successfully — before the fix this returned a 500 and no session could start. `getServerEnv()` itself is unchanged and still throws when the Gemini key is missing, because its other callers depend on that. An unauthenticated request returns the existing 401 EVEN when the provider is unconfigured, so an anonymous caller cannot probe the deployment's configuration; only a signed-in caller can learn that a provider key is unset.

### R-075 | area: stt-abstraction | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** Speech-to-text sits behind a documented provider contract, and exactly one short-lived credential is minted per stream. ElevenLabs tokens are single-use and consumed on use, so a second fetch is not merely wasteful.

**Steps:**
1. Read the contract comment and `createSttStream` in `hello-world/lib/copilot/stt/index.js`.
2. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism lib/copilot/stt/index.test.js lib/copilot/stt/token.test.js lib/copilot/stt/deepgram.token.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** `createSttStream` fetches exactly ONE token per call and threads both the resolved provider and that token into the constructed instance — assert the call count, not merely that it worked. An explicit provider argument forces that choice; an omitted or unrecognized provider name resolves to Deepgram rather than throwing, so a bad value degrades to today's behavior. A token fetch that fails still returns a usable Deepgram instance with no injected token, leaving `connect()` to surface the real error rather than failing at selection time. A provider constructed directly with no token still fetches its own, which is what keeps `deepgram.test.js` valid.

### R-076 | area: stt-abstraction | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** Both copilot session types construct their transcription stream through the abstraction, and Deepgram's wire behavior is unchanged by the move.

**Steps:**
1. Confirm `lib/copilot/session.js` and `lib/copilot/practiceSession.js` both obtain their stream from `createSttStream` rather than constructing a provider directly.
2. Read `lib/copilot/stt/deepgram.js` and compare its connection parameters against what the live copilot used before the refactor.
3. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism lib/copilot/session.test.js lib/copilot/practiceSession.test.js lib/copilot/stt/deepgram.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** Deepgram keeps the same listen URL, the same query parameters (model, encoding, sample_rate, channels, interim_results, smart_format, punctuate, endpointing), the same `["token", <token>]` subprotocol, the same non-Results frame filtering, the same empty-transcript skip, the same `start`/`duration` passthrough and the same `CloseStream` flush on close. `PracticeSession` still assigns its stream reference BEFORE awaiting `connect()`, so the stop-during-connect guards from R-041 still hold. The session tests pass with their assertions unchanged — that is the evidence the refactor preserved behavior, and any rewording of them would destroy it.

### R-077 | area: stt-elevenlabs | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** The ElevenLabs provider speaks the documented wire protocol, including the fields the service requires but the copilot's own pipeline knows nothing about.

**Steps:**
1. Read `connect()` and `send()` in `hello-world/lib/copilot/stt/elevenlabs.js`.
2. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism lib/copilot/stt/elevenlabs.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** The socket is opened with `model_id=scribe_v2_realtime`, `audio_format=pcm_16000`, `include_timestamps=true`, `commit_strategy=vad` and the token. `send()` accepts the same 16 kHz mono PCM16 `ArrayBuffer` every caller already passes, base64-encodes it into `audio_base_64`, and sends `message_type: "input_audio_chunk"` with `sample_rate: 16000` and `commit: false` — `commit` is documented as required, and `false` is the correct value under a VAD commit strategy where the server decides utterance boundaries. The base64 round-trips the original bytes exactly, including 0x00 and 0xFF and across the internal encode-loop boundary. Nothing is sent when the socket is not open.

### R-078 | area: stt-elevenlabs | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** The ElevenLabs transcript mapping, which is where this provider silently succeeds or silently corrupts everything downstream.

**Steps:**
1. Read the message-type switch and the span derivation in `hello-world/lib/copilot/stt/elevenlabs.js`.
2. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism lib/copilot/stt/elevenlabs.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** `partial_transcript` maps to isFinal false / speechFinal false; `final_transcript` and `final_transcript_with_timestamps` map to isFinal true / speechFinal FALSE; `committed_transcript` and `committed_transcript_with_timestamps` map to isFinal true / speechFinal TRUE. That last mapping is the one that makes live-mode question detection work at all — under `commit_strategy=vad` a commit IS the end-of-utterance signal, the role Deepgram's `speech_final` plays — so it is asserted directly rather than incidentally. `start` and `duration` derive from the `words` array using only entries whose `type` is `word`, excluding spacing and audio-event entries. When there is no usable `words` array, BOTH are `undefined` and never a fabricated 0: `answerWindow.js` reads undefined as "no timing available", so a 0 would silently corrupt every practice-mode delivery number without ever throwing. Empty or whitespace-only text is skipped, and `session_started` and `committed_transcript_entities` never reach `onTranscript`.

### R-079 | area: stt-elevenlabs | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** The tripwire for the wire format differing from the documentation. This provider was implemented against published docs and has never been exercised against the live service, so a protocol mismatch must announce itself rather than presenting as a session that transcribes nothing.

**Steps:**
1. Read the error handling and the unknown-message-type reporting in `hello-world/lib/copilot/stt/elevenlabs.js`.
2. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism lib/copilot/stt/elevenlabs.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** Every documented error `message_type` routes to `onError` with a useful message and is not treated as unrecognized. An UNRECOGNIZED `message_type` is reported through `onError` exactly ONCE per session, naming the type — it must fire, and it must not spam once per message. An abnormal socket close surfaces through `onError` in addition to `onStatus("closed")`, while a close initiated by the module's own `close()` does not. The module carries a comment recording that it was written against documentation rather than verified against the live service, so the provenance of its assumptions is legible to the next reader.

### R-080 | area: copilot-config | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** Provider selection is a server decision, misconfiguration names the provider actually selected, and asking which provider is live costs nothing.

**Steps:**
1. Read `getSttProvider` and `getElevenLabsApiKey` in `hello-world/lib/config/env.js`.
2. Read both the `GET` and `POST` handlers in `app/api/copilot/token/route.js`.
3. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism lib/config/env.test.js app/api/copilot/token/route.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** `STT_PROVIDER` selects the provider; unset, empty or unrecognized values resolve to Deepgram, so today's deploys are unaffected. `GET` returns `{ provider }` only — it mints nothing and makes no outbound provider call, which is the entire reason it exists: learning the provider name for the consent notice must not burn a single-use credential on every page view. `GET` is auth-gated exactly like `POST`, with auth ahead of configuration. `POST` mints from the selected provider, sending `xi-api-key` to the ElevenLabs single-use-token endpoint on that path. When the selected provider's key is unset the response is a 503 naming THAT provider and THAT environment variable, and it never silently falls back to the other provider.

### R-081 | area: copilot-privacy | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: no

**Summary:** The copilot tells the user which transcription service actually receives their audio, rather than a hardcoded name.

**Steps:**
1. Read how the provider display name is obtained and used in `hello-world/app/copilot/CopilotClient.js`.
2. Read the privacy notice construction in `hello-world/app/copilot/practice/PracticeClient.js`.

**Expected:** The destination name is derived from the provider the server reports, not hardcoded to either vendor. Before the provider is known the notice omits the destination clause entirely rather than guessing or naming a placeholder. The engine clause, the camera-frames clause and the save-recordings clause are independent of this and unchanged. The provider probe uses the non-minting GET, so simply opening the copilot does not consume a transcription credential.
