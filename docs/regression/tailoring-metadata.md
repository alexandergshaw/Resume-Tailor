### R-016 | area: tailoring-metadata | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** A resume-only revise must not null out the cover letter's stored framing metadata. This was a pre-existing bug.

**Steps:**
1. Read the metadata write block near the end of `resubmitDocumentPreview` in `app/hooks/useDocumentPreview.js`.

**Expected:** `focusInfo`, `keywordsInfo`, `personaInfo` and `coverVariantInfo` are each written only when the call actually touched that scope. A resume-only revise leaves `coverVariantInfo` untouched rather than overwriting it with null.
