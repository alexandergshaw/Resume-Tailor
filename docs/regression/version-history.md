### R-020 | area: version-history | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** Version history reads the append-only generation rows by position, newest first.

**Steps:**
1. Read `lib/supabase/documentVersions.js`.

**Expected:** The query selects from `generated_resumes` or `generated_cover_letters` per scope, filters on `position_id`, orders by `created_at` descending, and is capped with the reason documented. It returns an empty array on any error and never throws.

### R-021 | area: version-history | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** Selecting a version restores it as current content without losing in-progress typing, and the choice survives a reload.

**Steps:**
1. Read the version selection handler in `app/hooks/useDocumentPreview.js` and its `onSelect` wiring in `app/components/DocumentPreviewDialog.js`.

**Expected:** The handler flushes the pending auto-save (`commitDraft`) BEFORE switching. Selecting writes the version's content and lines for that scope only, sets that scope's `edited` to false, invalidates only that scope's cached render, and best-effort updates `applications.resume_used_id` or `cover_letter_id` so a reload restores the chosen version. The control is disabled only while its own scope is busy.

### R-022 | area: version-history | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** The version control degrades gracefully rather than showing an empty or broken selector.

**Steps:**
1. Read `app/components/preview/VersionControl.js`.

**Expected:** It renders nothing when there are fewer than two versions. Signed-out and no-position cases resolve to an empty version list upstream without console errors.
