### R-001 | area: cover-letter-grounding | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** With a tailored resume supplied, the cover letter prompt grounds on it and drops the instruction that steered the model away from the resume's language.

**Steps:**
1. From `hello-world`, run `npx vitest run lib/llm/buildCoverLetterPrompt.test.js`.

**Expected:** All tests pass. The prompt built with a usable `tailoredResume` contains the tailored-resume header and the tailored text, also contains the original resume as background grounding, and does NOT contain the phrase "do not copy phrasing wholesale".

### R-002 | area: cover-letter-grounding | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** Without a usable tailored resume, the prompt falls back to the original pre-feature behavior.

**Steps:**
1. From `hello-world`, run `npx vitest run lib/llm/buildCoverLetterPrompt.test.js`.

**Expected:** When `tailoredResume` is undefined, null, or carries only whitespace, the prompt contains the "Source resume (for factual grounding only" header including "do not copy phrasing wholesale", and does not contain the tailored-resume header.

### R-004 | area: cover-letter-grounding | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** Client-supplied tailored resume lines take precedence over the resume tailored in the same request. This is what makes cover-only regeneration use the resume you are actually keeping.

**Steps:**
1. From `hello-world`, run `npx vitest run app/api/tailor/pickTailoredResume.test.js`.

**Expected:** All tests pass. Non-empty client lines win over a populated resume result; an empty, missing, or non-array client value falls through to the resume result; a null or undefined resume result yields an empty shape rather than throwing.

### R-005 | area: cover-letter-grounding | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** The tailored resume text resolver treats unusable input as absent so the caller can fall back.

**Steps:**
1. From `hello-world`, run `npx vitest run lib/llm/resolveTailoredResumeText.test.js`.

**Expected:** All tests pass, including that a whitespace-only `result` falls through to `resultLines` rather than winning, and that `result` takes precedence over `resultLines` when both carry content.

### R-006 | area: cover-letter-grounding | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** The tailoring route wires the tailored resume through to the engine, and the client sends its stored lines only on a cover-only revise. Not covered by unit tests: the client-side form append lives inside a React hook and is verified by inspection here.

**Steps:**
1. Read `hello-world/app/api/tailor/route.js` and locate the `tailorCoverLetter` call.
2. Read `hello-world/app/hooks/useDocumentPreview.js` and locate the `tailoredResumeLines` form append and the `applyCover` definition.

**Expected:** The route passes a `tailoredResume` option built by `pickTailoredResume`. The client appends `tailoredResumeLines` guarded by `applyCover`, and `applyCover` is defined as the cover scope AND not a focus change, so a focus change or a resume-scope revise falls through to the freshly tailored resume instead of stale stored lines.
