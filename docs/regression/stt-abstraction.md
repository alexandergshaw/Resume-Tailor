### R-075 | area: stt-abstraction | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** Speech-to-text sits behind a documented provider contract, and exactly one short-lived credential is minted per stream. ElevenLabs tokens are single-use and consumed on use, so a second fetch is not merely wasteful.

**Steps:**
1. Read the contract comment and `createSttStream` in `hello-world/lib/copilot/stt/index.js`.
2. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism lib/copilot/stt/index.test.js lib/copilot/stt/token.test.js lib/copilot/stt/deepgram.token.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** `createSttStream` fetches exactly ONE token per call and threads both the resolved provider and that token into the constructed instance — assert the call count, not merely that it worked. An explicit provider argument forces that choice; an omitted or unrecognized provider name resolves to Deepgram rather than throwing, so a bad value degrades to today's behavior. A token fetch that fails still returns a usable Deepgram instance with no injected token, leaving `connect()` to surface the real error rather than failing at selection time. A provider constructed directly with no token still fetches its own, which is what keeps `deepgram.test.js` valid.

### R-076 | area: stt-abstraction | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** Both copilot session types construct their transcription stream through the abstraction, and Deepgram's wire behavior is unchanged by the move.

**Steps:**
1. Confirm `lib/copilot/session.js` and `lib/copilot/practiceSession.js` both obtain their stream from `createSttStream` rather than constructing a provider directly.
2. Read `lib/copilot/stt/deepgram.js` and compare its connection parameters against what the live copilot used before the refactor.
3. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism lib/copilot/session.test.js lib/copilot/practiceSession.test.js lib/copilot/stt/deepgram.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** Deepgram keeps the same listen URL, the same query parameters (model, encoding, sample_rate, channels, interim_results, smart_format, punctuate, endpointing), the same `["token", <token>]` subprotocol, the same non-Results frame filtering, the same empty-transcript skip, the same `start`/`duration` passthrough and the same `CloseStream` flush on close. `PracticeSession` still assigns its stream reference BEFORE awaiting `connect()`, so the stop-during-connect guards from R-041 still hold. The session tests pass with their assertions unchanged — that is the evidence the refactor preserved behavior, and any rewording of them would destroy it.
