### R-008 | area: headless-tailoring | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** Automated queue tailoring grounds the letter in the resume it just tailored, not a re-extraction of the original upload.

**Steps:**
1. Read `hello-world/lib/feed/tailorAndQueue.js` around the `tailorCoverLetterHeadless` call.
2. Read `hello-world/lib/llm/tailorForUserHeadless.js` for the `tailoredResume` parameter.

**Expected:** `tailorAndQueue.js` passes `tailoredResume` built from the resume draft it generated moments earlier, and `tailorCoverLetterHeadless` accepts and forwards it to the engine.
