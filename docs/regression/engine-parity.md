### R-007 | area: engine-parity | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** The embedded and external engines tolerate the new option without behavior change, and embedded output stays deterministic.

**Steps:**
1. From `hello-world`, run `npx vitest run`.

**Expected:** The full suite passes with no tailor-lite determinism failures. The embedded engine accepts `tailoredResume` via its options object without destructuring it; the external engine's outbound HTTP body is unchanged.
