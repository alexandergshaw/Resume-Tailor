### R-011 | area: preview-concurrency | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** Working on one document must not disable the other. This is the core of per-document concurrency.

**Steps:**
1. From `hello-world`, run `npx vitest run lib/tailor/previewScopes.lockScopesFor.test.js lib/tailor/previewScopes.applyScopeFlags.test.js`.
2. Read `app/components/DocumentPreviewDialog.js` and locate every `disabled=` guard.

**Expected:** Tests pass. The per-scope download and revise controls are gated on `busyActive` (the active tab's own flag), NOT on `anyBusy`. Only the combined download and the both-document operations (focus picker, framing, scan posting) use `anyBusy`.

### R-012 | area: preview-concurrency | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** A finishing operation on one document must not discard uncommitted edits on the other. This was a silent data-loss path.

**Steps:**
1. From `hello-world`, run `npx vitest run lib/tailor/previewScopes.changedScopes.test.js`.
2. Read the `reloadKey` handling block in `app/components/DocumentPreviewDialog.js`.

**Expected:** Tests pass, including that a scope missing from the previous signatures counts as changed. The reload handler clears cached renders and `draftHtmlRef` only for scopes whose content signature actually changed, and only drops out of edit mode when the ACTIVE scope changed.

### R-013 | area: preview-concurrency | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** busy, notice and error are per-scope objects, and no surviving code treats them as scalars. An object is always truthy, so a missed truthiness check would pin a banner open permanently.

**Steps:**
1. From `hello-world`, search `app/hooks/useDocumentPreview.js`, `app/page.js` and `app/components/DocumentPreviewDialog.js` for reads of `busy`, `notice` and `error`.

**Expected:** Every consumer indexes by scope (for example `busy?.[tab]`, `notice?.[tab] || ""`). No bare truthiness test on the whole object exists anywhere.

### R-014 | area: preview-concurrency | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** Re-entrancy guards are ref-based, not render-closure based, so a fast double-click cannot slip through.

**Steps:**
1. Read `resubmitDocumentPreview` and `downloadDocumentPreview` in `app/hooks/useDocumentPreview.js`.

**Expected:** Both guard on `inFlightScopesRef` (a ref, always current), acquire before the first await, and release in a `finally`. Downloads use a `download:` prefixed key so a download and a revise on the same scope are tracked independently and never block each other.

### R-027 | area: preview-concurrency | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** Hand edits to one document survive a regeneration of the other. The `edited` flag was entry-wide, so editing the cover letter and then regenerating the resume silently made the cover letter download serve a stale pre-edit document while the preview still showed the edits.

**Steps:**
1. Search the whole repo (`app` and `lib`) for reads of `.edited`.
2. Read the `editedForScope` helper and its callers in `app/hooks/useDocumentPreview.js`, `app/hooks/useCompanyResearch.js`, `app/page.js`, `lib/document/docx.js` and `app/components/StatusBar.js`.

**Expected:** `edited` is a per-scope object `{ resume, cover }`. EVERY read is scope-indexed through a helper; no bare `if (entry.edited)` or `!entry.edited` survives anywhere, because an object is always truthy and a bare check would silently invert behavior. A resume regeneration clears only `edited.resume`; a cover-letter hand edit sets only `edited.cover`; the company-research weave sets only the cover scope. A legacy boolean value is tolerated and read as edited on both scopes, which is the safe direction because it forces a rebuild rather than a stale verbatim serve.
