### R-045 | area: practice-postings | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** The practice posting picker offers exactly the rows the Tracking table shows, and a failed load is never reported to the user as an empty account.

**Steps:**
1. Read `fetchPracticePostings` and `normalizePostingRows` in `hello-world/lib/copilot/postings.js`, and compare the query against `loadApplications` in `hello-world/app/page.js`.
2. Read the `noOptionsText` and helper-text branches in `hello-world/app/copilot/practice/PostingPicker.js`.
3. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism lib/copilot/postings.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** The query is `applications` joined to `positions`, filtered to the signed-in user, excluding statuses `tracking` and `auto_tailored`, ordered by `applied_at` descending. Rows with no joined position, or with neither a title nor a company, are dropped; duplicates on title+company collapse case-insensitively keeping the newest; a row with a missing or unparseable `applied_at` is still included and merely sorts last. Signed out returns an empty list without querying, while an auth-lookup error and a query error are each thrown so the picker can show them. When the load fails, the dropdown says the load failed — it must NOT say the user has no tracked postings.
