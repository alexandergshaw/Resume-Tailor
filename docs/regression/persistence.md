### R-017 | area: persistence | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** Interactively generated cover letters persist. Previously only the automated queue ever wrote a cover letter row, so a browser-generated letter was lost on reload.

**Steps:**
1. Search the repo for callers of `saveGeneratedCoverLetter` and of `persistGeneratedDocuments`.

**Expected:** Every interactive generate path in `app/page.js` persists the cover letter when one was generated, via the shared helper in `lib/supabase/persistGeneration.js`. The helper never writes `docx_path` for cover letters, because `generated_cover_letters` has no such column.

### R-018 | area: persistence | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** Auto-save must never write database rows. It fires on a 600ms debounce while typing; persisting there would create hundreds of rows per session and make the version list unusable.

**Steps:**
1. Read `saveDocumentPreview` in `app/hooks/useDocumentPreview.js` in full.

**Expected:** Its body contains no Supabase client creation, no await, and no call to any persistence helper. Only regenerations persist.

### R-019 | area: persistence | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** The revise path must never write to the positions table. `upsertPosition` is a full-row upsert built for freshly scraped job objects and would null out location, salary, employment type, posted date and raw_data when called with partial preview data.

**Steps:**
1. Search `app/hooks/useDocumentPreview.js` for every access to the `positions` table.

**Expected:** Position access from this hook is read-only (`.select("id").eq("external_id", ...)`). There is no `upsert`, `insert`, `update` or `delete` against `positions` anywhere in the hook, and `upsertPosition` is not imported by it. The four generate flows in `app/page.js` legitimately still call `upsertPosition`, because they hold a complete job object.
