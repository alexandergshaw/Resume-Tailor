### R-040 | area: practice-capture | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** Practice mode captures the candidate's own camera and mic, and a camera failure degrades to microphone-only without blaming the wrong device. `getUserMedia` is atomic, so a combined request also rejects when the MICROPHONE is the problem, and the old wording blamed the camera for that.

**Steps:**
1. Read `captureCameraAndMic` and the shared `MIC_AUDIO_CONSTRAINTS` in `hello-world/lib/copilot/capture.js`.
2. Read `start()` in `hello-world/lib/copilot/practiceSession.js`.
3. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism lib/copilot/capture.test.js lib/copilot/practiceSession.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** `captureCameraAndMic` requests 720p-ideal front-facing video plus the processed mic constraints, and `captureMicAudio`'s own argument is unchanged by the extraction of that shared constant. A granted stream with no audio track has every track stopped before a microphone-specific error is thrown. The soft "Camera unavailable (...). Continuing with microphone only." warning is emitted ONLY after the mic-only fallback actually succeeds; when the fallback also fails, the ORIGINAL combined-request error propagates and no camera-blaming warning is emitted.

### R-041 | area: practice-capture | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** A Stop that lands while the session is still connecting leaves nothing running. Without the guard this leaked a billed Deepgram socket and a live AudioContext, and repainted the UI as live with the session unreachable.

**Steps:**
1. Read `start()` and `stop()` in `hello-world/lib/copilot/practiceSession.js`, specifically where `_dg` and `_pipeline` are assigned relative to their awaits and where `_stopped` is re-checked.
2. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism lib/copilot/practiceSession.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** `_dg` and `_pipeline` are assigned to the instance BEFORE their `connect()` / `start()` are awaited, and `_stopped` is re-checked after every await. A `stop()` during the Deepgram handshake, and a `stop()` during the AudioWorklet load, each end with the socket closed, the pipeline stopped, every track stopped, and a final status of `idle`. A late `open` arriving after teardown never repaints the status to `live` — every callback forwarded from the socket is swallowed once `_stopped` is set.

### R-042 | area: practice-capture | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** A Deepgram socket that closes on its own tears the capture down for real. Reporting `idle` while the camera and mic kept running left the user with a lit camera indicator and no Stop button.

**Steps:**
1. Read the `onStatus` handler passed to `DeepgramStream` in `hello-world/lib/copilot/practiceSession.js`.
2. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism lib/copilot/practiceSession.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** An unsolicited `closed` while the session is running calls `stop()`, so every track is stopped and the status reaches `idle` — it is not a cosmetic status change. A `closed` arriving as a result of the app's own `stop()` does not recurse. The video track's `ended` listener flips `hasVideo` false and re-publishes through `onStream` WITHOUT stopping the session, since audio-only is a valid state; the audio track's `ended` listener does tear the session down.
