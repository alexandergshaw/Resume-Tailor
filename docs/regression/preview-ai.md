### R-015 | area: preview-ai | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** The Ask AI button opens a chat the user can actually see. ChatPanel sits at z-index 1100 and MUI dialogs default to 1300.

**Steps:**
1. Read the Ask AI handler in `app/components/DocumentPreviewDialog.js` and its wiring in `app/page.js`.

**Expected:** The handler commits any pending edit, then closes the preview, then opens the chat. ChatPanel's z-index is NOT raised globally. The pinned context carries the company, role, which document, the document text, and `sourceJobId` so the existing refresh effect keeps it current.
