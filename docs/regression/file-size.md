### R-026 | area: file-size | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** The project's 1000-line-per-file cap holds for every file touched by this work.

**Steps:**
1. From the repo root, run a line count over `hello-world/app/components/DocumentPreviewDialog.js`, `hello-world/app/components/preview/*.js`, `hello-world/app/hooks/useDocumentPreview.js`, `hello-world/lib/document/versionDiff.js`, `hello-world/lib/supabase/documentVersions.js`, `hello-world/lib/supabase/persistGeneration.js` and `hello-world/lib/tailor/previewScopes.js`.

**Expected:** Every one is under 1000 lines. Known pre-existing exception: `hello-world/app/page.js` is over 3000 lines and is being reduced by a separate consolidation effort; this work only added minimal prop wiring to it.
