### R-034 | area: copilot-audio | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** The interviewer's audio source is selectable, and anything unrecognized degrades to the browser-tab path rather than throwing. Tab sharing was the only source before this option existed, so an unrecognized value must never break a session that used to work.

**Steps:**
1. Read `THEM_CAPTURE_BY_SOURCE` and the `CopilotSession` constructor in `hello-world/lib/copilot/session.js`.
2. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism lib/copilot/session.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** `source: "system"` selects `captureSystemAudio`; `source: "tab"`, an omitted `source`, and an unrecognized value all select `captureTabAudio`. The constructor never throws on a bad source. The "them" source is still captured before the mic prompt, so its picker appears first.

**Amended (group M):** a third source, `"inperson"`, now exists and does NOT go through `THEM_CAPTURE_BY_SOURCE` at all -- it calls no `getDisplayMedia` function whatsoever and captures only the microphone. The degradation rule above is unchanged and is what this case still protects: an unrecognized value must resolve to `captureTabAudio`, NOT to the new mic-only path. See R-144.

### R-035 | area: copilot-audio | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** System-audio capture requests the constraints Chrome actually needs, and fails with instructions specific to that path. A generic or tab-worded error here sends the user to the wrong checkbox in the share dialog.

**Steps:**
1. Read `captureSystemAudio` in `hello-world/lib/copilot/capture.js`.
2. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism lib/copilot/capture.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** `getDisplayMedia` is called with `systemAudio: "include"`, `monitorTypeSurfaces: "include"`, and a `monitor` `displaySurface`, plus the shared raw-signal audio constraints (echoCancellation, noiseSuppression and autoGainControl all false). When the granted stream has no audio track, EVERY track is stopped before throwing, so no share indicator is left lit. When the shared surface was the whole screen, the thrown message names "Entire Screen" and "Share system audio" and states honestly that Chrome cannot capture system audio on macOS. The other surfaces get their own wording -- see R-039.

### R-036 | area: copilot-audio | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** Adding the system-audio option did not change tab capture. Tab sharing is the default and the only path that works on macOS, so a silent change here would break the majority path.

**Steps:**
1. Read `captureTabAudio` and the shared `DISPLAY_AUDIO_CONSTRAINTS` / `requireAudioTrack` helpers in `hello-world/lib/copilot/capture.js`.
2. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism lib/copilot/capture.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** `captureTabAudio` still requests `video: true` (Chrome will not grant tab audio without a video track) with the same three raw-signal audio constraints, and still throws the tab-specific message naming a browser tab and "Share tab audio" -- not the system-audio wording. The two capture paths share one constraints constant and one no-audio-track guard so they cannot drift apart.

### R-037 | area: copilot-audio | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** The source control cannot change under a running session, and the choice survives a reload. Switching source mid-session would leave the UI describing a source the live Deepgram streams are not using.

**Steps:**
1. Read the `ToggleButtonGroup`, `onSourceChange`, the `SOURCE_STORAGE_KEY` seeding effect, and the `shareInstructions` text in `hello-world/app/copilot/CopilotClient.js`.
2. Confirm `source` is passed to `new CopilotSession(...)` and is in the `start` callback's dependency array.

**Expected:** The control is disabled whenever status is `live` or `connecting`. `onSourceChange` ignores a null value (an exclusive ToggleButtonGroup emits null when the active button is clicked again), so the selection can never be cleared. The choice is stored under `copilot-audio-source`, which is a different key from `copilot-prep-context`; reads and writes are wrapped in try/catch and an unrecognized stored value falls back to `tab`. The instructional paragraph names Entire Screen and "Share system audio" for the system option and the meeting tab for the tab option.

### R-038 | area: copilot-audio | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** Session teardown and failure semantics are unchanged by the new source option. The mic has always been optional and the interviewer source fatal; inverting either would either kill working sessions or leave a session silently transcribing nothing.

**Steps:**
1. Read `start`, `_addSource` and `stop` in `hello-world/lib/copilot/session.js`.
2. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism lib/copilot/session.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** A failure of the "them" capture (tab or system) rejects out of `start()` and is fatal. A mic failure is soft: it reports through onError and the session continues with interviewer audio only. Each source still gets its own PcmPipeline and DeepgramStream, which is what provides speaker separation without diarization. The first audio track of every source still gets an "ended" listener so the browser's native "Stop sharing" tears the session down.

**Amended (group M):** every sentence above still holds for `"tab"` and `"system"`, and that is now precisely the point of this case -- those two paths must stay byte-identical. It is NO LONGER true of the session as a whole. On the new `"inperson"` source there is exactly one source, the microphone is REQUIRED (its failure is fatal and rejects out of `start()`, with wording that must not reuse "continuing with interviewer audio only"), and speaker separation comes from diarization rather than from having two streams. See R-144 and R-147.

### R-039 | area: copilot-audio | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** When system-audio capture yields no audio, the error names the mistake the user actually made. `displaySurface: "monitor"` is advisory per spec and cannot restrict the picker, so the user can still land on a window or a tab -- and the original message told every one of them to tick a "Share system audio" checkbox that Chrome never shows for those surfaces.

**Steps:**
1. Read `readDisplaySurface`, `buildSystemAudioMessage`, `SYSTEM_AUDIO_MESSAGES_BY_SURFACE` and `requireAudioTrack` in `hello-world/lib/copilot/capture.js`.
2. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism lib/copilot/capture.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** The video track's `getSettings().displaySurface` is read BEFORE any track is stopped, since a stopped track's settings may be cleared. A `window` surface produces a message saying a window share carries no system audio on Windows and to pick "Entire Screen" instead, and it must NOT tell the user to turn on a "Share system audio" checkbox. A `browser` surface produces a message pointing at this app's own "Browser tab" interviewer-audio option. A `monitor` surface, an unrecognized surface, a missing `getSettings`, a `getSettings` that throws, a stream with no video track, and a stream that does not implement `getVideoTracks` at all ALL fall back to the whole-screen wording rather than raising a TypeError. In every one of these failure cases every granted track still has `stop()` called exactly once.

### R-043 | area: copilot-audio | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** `PcmPipeline` closes an AudioContext whose worklet load was interrupted by a concurrent stop. This affects the LIVE interview path as well as practice mode — before the fix, any Stop racing the module load leaked a running AudioContext for the life of the page.

**Steps:**
1. Read `PcmPipeline.start()` and `PcmPipeline.stop()` in `hello-world/lib/copilot/capture.js`.
2. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism lib/copilot/capture.test.js lib/copilot/practiceSession.test.js lib/copilot/session.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** `this.ctx` is assigned immediately after the AudioContext is constructed, BEFORE `addModule` is awaited, so a concurrent `stop()` always has something to close. `start()` re-checks its stopped flag after that await and returns without building the node graph when it is set, so `createMediaStreamSource` is never called on a closed context and no spurious error surfaces to a user who pressed Stop. The flag resets at the top of `start()` so the instance stays reusable.

### R-044 | area: copilot-audio | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** The live interview session can never be stranded by leaving its view. The mode toggle keys off the session's existence rather than its status, because `status === "error"` leaves a `CopilotSession` holding the screen share and mic while the UI already shows "Start session".

**Steps:**
1. Read `onModeChange` in `hello-world/app/copilot/CopilotClient.js` and the unmount-cleanup effect in `hello-world/app/copilot/useLiveSession.js` (the session pipeline moved there in group M; `onModeChange` stayed behind and calls the hook's `stop`).
2. Confirm the mode `ToggleButtonGroup` ignores a null value and is disabled while the live session is running.

**Expected:** Switching to practice mode stops any existing live session first, keyed on `sessionRef.current` existing rather than on `status`. Unmounting `CopilotClient` (switching main tabs in `app/page.js`) also stops the session, mirroring `PracticeClient`. Nothing about the audio-source toggle, the `copilot-audio-source` storage key, the share-instruction wording, the `CopilotSession` wiring or the question/answer flow is changed by this — R-034 through R-039 all still hold.

### R-144 | area: copilot-audio | parallel-safe: yes | automatable: yes

**Summary:** A live session can run on the microphone alone, for an in-person interview where there is no tab or system audio carrying the other person's voice. Before this, `start()` awaited the display-capture as its very first act, so an in-person interview could not start a session at all.

**Steps:**
1. Read `start`, `_startInPerson`, `_addSource` and `stop` in `hello-world/lib/copilot/session.js`.
2. Run `npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism lib/copilot/session.inperson.test.js lib/copilot/session.test.js` from `hello-world/`.

**Expected:** `source: "inperson"` calls NO `getDisplayMedia` function -- not `captureTabAudio`, not `captureSystemAudio` -- and opens exactly one transcription stream, requesting diarization on it. The microphone is REQUIRED in this mode: its failure rejects out of `start()` with wording saying the session cannot start, and never reuses `micFailureMessage`'s "Continuing with interviewer audio only", which is false when the mic IS the session. `withMic: false` is ignored rather than producing a zero-source session whose `aggregateStatus()` reads "idle" while nothing transcribes. The `_stopped` re-check still runs after the `captureMicAudio` await (R-041). An unrecognized source value still falls back to the tab path, never to mic-only. `"tab"` and `"system"` are unchanged: two sources, no diarization requested, the frame reaching `onTranscript` byte-identical to before with no `speakerTag` own-key, and `onUtterance` never fired.
